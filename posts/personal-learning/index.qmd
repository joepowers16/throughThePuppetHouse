In a recent interview Rick Rubin discussed how ~"local optimum is not the global optimum." And this this had two implications: 

1. Even when you've hit your best yet, you need to keep exploring for better ways. 

2. when giving advice or taking advice, you need to be aware that what worked for someone else in their circumstances may not work for you in yours. 

There is so much to unpack here, but I want to focus on how is speaks to the very personal nature of optimal learning. Learning how we learn is a very personal and lifelong quest, one that easily gets short stopped in local optima. And one tragedy is how the idea of personal learning has been co-opted by "learning styles." As though the nuances of how you learn can be generalized into a simple bucket: "I'm a visual learner," which is about as accurate and useful as stating, "I'm a Chevy guy."

The personal learning I am speaking about is one of reflection, experimentation, and model building, building a model of how you learn, a model that can be put into practice with demonstrably better outcomes for your own development. I'll give an example. 

I cannot learn efficiently from semester length courses. I am not an anomoly. The semester length course is developed to accomodate several assumptions that are not relevant to me: Free time, an academic schedule, and prerequisite knowledge. I lack all three in many cases, such that even when I put in the time, I lack the prerequisite knowledge and am simply nailing jello to a wall made of jello. I spent years trying to learn Bayesian statistics this way: Taking coursera courses or reading whole books end to end. Then I reflected: I am not making progress here, but I am making progress in other areas where I am trying to learn. What is different between those areas? I noticed that size, clarity, and deadlines were very different. In an area where I'd enjoyed success my learning goals tended to be narrow, focused and timely, e.g., gain read/write access between local IDE and Google Sheets by Nov-1 to automate an upcoming report. 

I quickly tried applying this to my Bayesian learning efforts: 

* Learn Bayesian Modeling --> Use a Bayesian model to AB test a Rate by Mar-1

It worked! And this initial success became a toe-hold for extensive further learning of Bayesian statistics. My next goal became:

* Use a Bayesian model to AB test a continuous metric by Apr-1

* Then power analysis, multi-variable models. 

# Transition
It is not my goal to argue that my method above it the globally optimal way to learn statistics or to learn Bayesian modeling. I am arguing that this worked dramatically better for me than attempting semester-long courses or reading books end-to-end. I believe that this worked better for me because I 

* I have a full-time job and a family, so I cannot make regular time that is assumed by a semester-length course, and I often lack many of the prerequisite skills that are required to maintain the pace of the course.

* Books are typically comprehensive, I doubt their authors even intend for their books to be digested in an end-to-end fashion. 

* While I lack the regular time of an undergrad or masters student, I have the advantage of pressing practical applications for the methods I am struggling to learn and I have the flexibility to dive deep when I stumble upon an unmet prerequisite. 

    * The practical applications tied to 

# another trick

* I'll offer another hack: Using simulation rather than mathematical understanding.

There is something fundamentally different about learning thorugh simulation: You actually get teh level of repetitive feedback that shapes your expectations.
